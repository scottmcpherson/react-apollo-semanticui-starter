Getting started

1.  Create a mysql database called starter_development or use a dirrerent name and update `development.database` in `server/config/config.json` to reflect the new name
2.  Run `yarn` or `npm i` inside the server and client folders
3.  In the server folder, create a file called .env and copy/paster the contents from .env.example to .env
4.  Run `yarn start` or `npm start` from the client and server folders

TODO

- [ ] Need to refactor client to use the latest apollo client API with `<Mutation></Mutation>` and <`Query></Query>`
